# OD_Simo_GustavSwanepoel_WD_WebResum-
Web Resum√© Final Project for deadline 22 March 2023

CHANGE LOG
-Added bootstrap components (jumbotron, navbar, card, form, modal, carousel)
-Added CSS animation (sliding transition) by using keyframes. 
-Viewport accommodated by using @media only screen in CSS (profile pic, body background color, and body's text changes - e.g. one column not two when small screen -  according to viewport)
-There was a pesky blue hyperlink underline mark next to my gmail icon, I removed it with text-decoration: none. 
-Bootstrap form was added, but it is a bit pointless; I still have to learn javascript and I am waiting for the LMS to update to continue. 
-I employed bootstrap containers and use the class="row" and class="col" to make use of a bootstrap grid (see body text). 
-I use the ALT+SHIFT+F to ensure my indentations line up correctly.
